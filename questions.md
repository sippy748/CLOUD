## Core Concepts

### 1. What are containers and how do they differ from traditional virtualization?
Answer:
Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. 

Key points:
- Containers share the host OS kernel
- They are lightweight and start up quickly
- They use less memory than VMs
- They provide consistent environments across different platforms

Traditional virtualization (VMs) differences:
- VMs have their own OS kernel
- VMs are heavier and take longer to start
- VMs provide stronger isolation
- VMs consume more resources

### 2. Explain the three pillars of container technology
Answer:
The three pillars are:

1. Namespaces:
- Provide isolation for system resources
- Types include: PID, Network, Mount, UTS, IPC, User
- Each container gets its own set of namespaces

2. Control Groups (cgroups):
- Manage and limit resource usage
- Control CPU, memory, disk I/O, network
- Prevent single container from exhausting host resources

3. Union File System:
- Layers files and directories
- Enables image layering and sharing
- Provides efficient storage and image building

### 3. What is Docker and explain its architecture in detail?
Answer:
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

Architecture components:
1. Docker Client:
   - CLI tool (docker commands)
   - Communicates with# Docker Interview Answers Guide

   Architecture components:
   1. Docker Client:
      - CLI tool (docker commands)
      - Communicates with Docker daemon
   
   2. Docker Daemon (dockerd):
      - Manages Docker objects
      - Handles container lifecycle
      - Listens for Docker API requests
   
   3. Docker Registry:
      - Stores Docker images
      - Docker Hub is the default public registry
      - Can have private registries
   
   4. Docker Objects:
      - Images: Read-only templates
      - Containers: Runnable instances
      - Networks: Communication between containers
      - Volumes: Persistent data storage Docker daemon
